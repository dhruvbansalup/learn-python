    "A restaurant always prepares dishes with the most orders before others with a lesser number of orders. Each dish in the restaurant menu has a unique integer ID. The restaurant receives n orders in a particular time period. The task is to find out the order of dish IDs according to which the restaurant will prepare them. Assume that restaurant has the following unique dish IDs in its menu:\n",
